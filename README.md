# Analysis-And-Visualization-For-Bike-Sharing-Systems-In-Warsaw

Jupyter Notebook contains data analysis and visualization of the bike-sharing system in Warsaw. The project uses over 4,100 JSON files, saved every 10 minutes, containing station data and lists of bikes located at each bike station in Warsaw.
The project uses archival meteorological data collected by the Institute of Meteorology and Water Management - available at https://danepubliczne.imgw.pl/datastore.

Main information about data:
- 4,184 JSON files, saved every 10 minutes between 03/04/2018 - 04/04/2018
- 1 JSON file contains information on an average of 355 bicycle stations in Warsaw

An overview of the most important attributes included in this set used in the analysis and visualization is presented below:

- uid - identifier of the bike station
- bikes - the number of bikes at a station
- bike_racks - the number of racks at a station
- free_racks - the number of free positions at a station
- bike_numbers - numbers of individual bikes pinned at a given station
- lat, lng - coordinates (longitude and latitude) of a bike station
